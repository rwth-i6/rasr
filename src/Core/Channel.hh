/**
 * @page Channels
 *
 * Instead of using cout and cerr directly you should use
 * channels.  Channels are named output streams that can be
 * configured and redirected individually.  Channels also take
 * care of character set conversion and (optionally) XML
 * formatting.  (Using cerr is only allowed in those places of
 * Core where the channel sub-system has not been set up yet.
 *
 * Channels cause NO (!) overhead compared to standard streams if
 * you use only a single destination stream.  Multiple destination
 * streams through redirection have the overhead of making multiple
 * copies of the data to be written (conversion to character strings
 * occurs only once!)
 *
 * Upon creation a Channel determines its set of targets via the
 * standard configuration process.  E.g. if your component is
 * called "recognizer" then Channel(config, "statistics"), will
 * look for a resource matching "recognizer.statistics.channel".
 * The resource's value is interpreted as a comma separated list
 * of target names, specifying were the channel's data is sent.
 *
 * The following channel targets are predefined:
 * -# "stdout" standard output of process
 * -# "stderr" standard error output of process
 * -# "nil"    suppress output
 *
 * All other target names cause the channel manager to create
 * additional targets as needed.  Each target is a Configurable
 * registered under "<application-title>.channels.<target-name>".
 * If the target name contains a dot, only the part after the dot
 * is used as parameter name.  By default a channel target will
 * open a file by its own name and write all output to this
 * file. This can be overridden with the "file" parameter.
 *
 * Channel targets can be configured in several ways:
 * -# The file name can be changed to something different from the
 *    target name using the "file" parameter.
 * -# If the file already exists it is overwritten by default.
 *    By setting "append" to true, the channel manager will append
 *    to the file instead of overwriting.
 * -# File output is buffered by default, which can cause long
 *    delay in the output.  Set "unbuffered" to change to
 *    line-buffering mode.
 * -# Internally channels expect to be provided with UTF-8 encoded
 *    character data.  (Plain ASCII is a subset of UTF-8.)  It is
 *    possible to specify a specific output encoding for each channel
 *    target, by setting the parameter "encoding" (ISO-8859-1 by
 *    default).  The channel will convert the data into this
 *    character set encoding upon output.
 * -# Channels feature automatic word-wrapping, which is disabled
 *    by default.  To enable word-wrapping, set the parameter
 *    "margin" to the number of characters per line.
 * -# XML (and possibly other) text is automatically indented.
 *    The parameter "indentation" controls the depth of indentation.
 *    Naturally, a value of zero, disable auto-indentation.
 * -# zlib compression can be activated using the "compressed" parameter.
 *    The filename will be extended by the suffix ".gz" if not already
 *    present
 *
 * You can check whether a channel's output is actually used by calling
 * isOpen().  Make use of this especially if your output needs additional
 * calculations.
 *
 * For plain text output use Channel.  If you want to produce XML
 * output, use the derived class XmlChannel.
