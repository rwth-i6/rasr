/**
 * @page Unicode Unicode
 *
 * Internally all text is processed in Unicode.  This allows Sprint to
 * work gracefully with any language, even multiple languages
 * simultaneously.
 *
 * @subsection about About Unicode
 *
 * Unicode (http://www.unicode.org) provides a unique number for every
 * character ever used in human writing.  Therefore we can consider
 * all character sets as representations (encodings) of Unicode.
 * Internally we use either the UTF-8 or the UCS-4 encoding.  UTF-8 is
 * more compact but uses multibyte characters.  UCS-4, using 4 bytes
 * for each character, is rather wasteful on memory, but easier to use
 * for string processing.  Conversion between UTF-8 and UCS-4 is
 * always possible using the widen() and narrow() functions.
 *
 * @subsection internal Internal character set
 *
 * Rule: Inside Sprint any text data must be either UTF-8 (string) or
 * UCS-4 (wstring).  If your code reads text data from an external
 * source (e.g. a file) you must ensure proper conversion.  Yet,
 * special measures need to be taken only rarely (see below).
 *
 * @subsection external External character sets
 *
 * Externally various character sets can be used.  Most popular ones
 * are ASCII (7 bit characters, onyl standard Latin alphapet) and
 * IS0-8859-1 (8 bit characters including accented characters for
 * Western European languages).  Conversion can be done using
 * UnicodeInputConverter and UnicodeOutputConverter, but the
 * recommended approach is:
 * - Input of text data should be in XML.  These are processed by
 *   XmlParser which automatically detects the encoding of the XML file
 *   and converts all data to UTF-8.  (XML files should have a header of
 *   the form <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> to ensure that
 *   the character encoding is always detected correctly.)
 * - Text output is most of the time done via Channels, which
 *   automatically convert to a run-time configurable encoding.
 * - Text embedded in binary files should be UTF-8 encoded.
 * - If non of the above applies, the classes TextOutputStream and
 *   TextInputStream can be used.
 * - As a last resort convert files externally to UTF-8 using the
 *   iconv(1) tool.
