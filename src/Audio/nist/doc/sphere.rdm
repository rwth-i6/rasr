0. Introduction:

SPeech HEader REsources (SPHERE) is a set of library functions and
command-level programs which can be used to read and modify
NIST-formatted speech waveform files.  The documentation for SPHERE
is located in the file, 'doc/sphere.doc'.  The SPHERE directory
hierarchy is organized as follows:

	bin                  - final destination of command line 
                               executables and UNIX shell scripts
	doc                  - SPHERE documentation
	doc/man/man1         - UNIX style manual pages for command
                               line executables
	doc/man/man3         - SPHERE function library UNIX style
                               manual pages 
	doc/man/man5         - SPHERE file formats
	include              - SPHERE include files
	include/sp           - SPHERE library include files
	include/shorten      - SHORTEN library include files
	include/wavpack      - WAVPACK library include files
	include/shpack       - SHORTPACK library include files
	include/util         - internal function include files
	lib                  - compiled link libraries
	lib/data             - Example/test waveform files
	src                  - SPHERE source code
	src/bin              - source code for SPHERE command line 
                               programs
	src/bin/h_edit.c     - source code for h_edit
	src/bin/h_delete.c   - source code for h_delete
	src/bin/h_nlrm.c     - source code for h_nlrm
